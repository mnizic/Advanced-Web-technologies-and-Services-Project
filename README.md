# Advanced-Web-technologies-and-Services-Project
Project I made for the course "Advanced Web technologies and Services" at Faculty of Organization and Informatics. I used Eclipse IDE, phpMyAdmin, mySQLWorkbench, Postman and some other tools to finish this project.

Using Maven it consists of 5 projects. First project, mnizic-aplikacija_1, serves as a socket server. Second, mnizic-aplikacija_2, retrieves data on departures and arrivals of planes from selected airports. Third, mnizic-aplikacija_3, is used as RESTful/JAX-RS web service. Fourth, mnizic-aplikacija_4, uses Jakarta MVC for Administration views. Fifth, mnizic-aplikacija_5, uses JAX-WS Web Service and WebSocket Endpoint.
